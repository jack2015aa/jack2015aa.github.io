I will  pursue a girl who has a high degree, when I graduate form university.

Because we can help each other during our marriage.

But it seems that it is hard for boys to pursue the girl who has a high degree and also has a high demand.

I think it worth a try, because I just need one, only one. As long as I get one, I won't need to do it more. So why not choose the best one?

The reason why I prefer the degree is because I think high quality decides the income in the future.

"Marriage that only considers money is ridiculous, and marriage that does not consider money is stupid."

Although the marriage is mostly considered by money, I want to translate it into "future income". Because it can be such a bad,bad life just staying with the money form the others' work.

So I would like a girl that we can help each other.
